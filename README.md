# SETUP GUIDE

Download the melonloader version of the PVZ Fusion Multilanguage translation here: https://github.com/Teyliu/PVZF-Translation
(Currently Multi-Language 3.1.1 has been tested)

Download PVZFusionArchipelago.zip and extract its contents into the same folder as PlantsVsZombiesRH.exe,
making sure that Archipelago.MultiClient.Net.dll is in UserLibs and PVZFusionArchipelago.dll is in Mods

To connect to a game, edit config.json which will be in the same folder as PVZFusionArchipelago.dll

Once you are in game, before doing anything, go into the settings and double click "complete all levels" (back up your save file beforehand if you care about it)
Also make sure "Dave picks cards on adventure NG+" is set to "does not select cards"
You will play the adventure through the challenges menu
